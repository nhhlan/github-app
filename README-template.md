## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JavaScript ES6

### What I learned

Throught this project, I learned a lot of concepts as well as tricks & tips to improve the overall completed app.
Some of the topic that I have researched and applied are:
- Dark mode
- Search bar with multiple element
- Import/export value from different file (CSS/JS)
- Infinite load / Load more
- Datetime manipulation
- Media query for JS 
- API from the Muse (because Github job is deprecated)
etc.

What I like most about these project is I have to research everything, which make me understand deeper about the concept of making, not just coding like a habit.

### Continued development

I still not comfortable with most of the things, but I will try different framework, maybe React next time.
